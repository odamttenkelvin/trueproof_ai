TrueProof AI - Deepfake Detection Model Integration

This module includes:
- `fake_detector.py`: Uses a pre-trained Keras model to analyze uploaded image files.
- `models/`: Place your `fake_cnn_model.h5` here.

To use:
1. Train or download a binary classifier model for fake/real detection.
2. Save the model as `models/fake_cnn_model.h5`.
3. Ensure TensorFlow and Pillow are installed.
4. Call classify_image(image_path) with a JPG/PNG image.

This is a mock integration for MVP testing.
