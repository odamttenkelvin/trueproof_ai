TrueProof AI - FakeCNN Model Training Template

Steps:
1. Download a dataset of real and fake faces (e.g., Kaggle).
   Recommended: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ciplab/real-and-fake-face-detection

2. Organize images as:
   /dataset/real/real_001.jpg
   /dataset/fake/fake_001.jpg

3. Run the training script:
   $ pip install tensorflow
   $ python train_fakecnn.py

4. After training, the model will be saved to:
   /models/fake_cnn_model.h5

This model can then be used with your FastAPI detector module.
